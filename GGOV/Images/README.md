# Images used in the GGO Mod

This folder contains all of the images used in the GGO Mod. You can modify this however you want for using them in your install.

## Weapon Images and the Templates

To make your own weapon images, open [Weapon Template.png](WeaponTemplate.png) with your favourite Image Editor and place your white image there.

For standard firearms, you can use all of the image. For melee weapons, you can only use the white part. This is because the melee weapon images are smaller than the firearms and the red part will end up outside of the image area.

## Packaging

To package a custom ytd, just make the following texture container/dictionaries for the respective directories:

* General for ggo.ytd
* Weapons for ggo_weapons.ytd
